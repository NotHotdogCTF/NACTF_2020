This is another iteration on the veggie problem.

In this problem we can only swap whatever is at indices 0 and 1 and can only otherwise shift all elements to the left one place

To accomplish this we will not actually model the movement of elements, instead we will write the shift character every time we increment our indices.

Thus with a small modification to our exploit.py file we have our solution in exploit2.py

Thus: python3 exploit2.py

This gives our flag:

nactf{1t_t4k35_tw0_t0_m4n90_8a51c7b47fbe227}
