In this challenge we are given 100 nested zip files.

In each file there are two zip files and a test file containing the name of the correct file to unzip.

As this would be extremely tedious to do by hand we wrote a script to do this for us and then output the flag for us

Running this file (python3 unzip.py) gives our flag

nactf{1_h0pe_y0u_d1dnt_d0_th4t_by_h4nd_87ce45b0}
