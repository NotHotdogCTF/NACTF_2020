In this challenge we are given a series of decimal numbers

We can take these numbers and convert them to hex

Once they are converted to hex we can then convert them to ascii characters to give the flag

However this gives something that does not resemble a flag barring 5 letters then a { followed by some letters with a closing }

However we can see that if we take the first 5 values and subtract 1 we get nactf

Thus if we do this to the stuff inside the brackets we get our flag

nactf{asc11_XB4RCR5}
