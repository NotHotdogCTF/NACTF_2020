This is the next iteration of the veggie problem.

Now the list is massive and we are introduced to a 10 second time limit.

Thus, we wrote a program to handle the sorting for us.

For this we wrote a bubble sort algorithm that writes the index it is considering every time it makes a swap

This gives us the string to send to the server.

Since the inputs change every time we connect we had to make the program interact with server and dynamically take in input.

Running the program (python3 exploit.py) will give us the flag

nactf{d0n7_w0rry_p34_h4ppy_f27ae283dd72cb62f685}
