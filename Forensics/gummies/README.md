This challenge gives us a png file and tells us that there is a message hidden within.

We chose to run this through a few stenography programs to see if we could extract the hidden data

Using the program stegoveritas we found some success.

After running the program we were given some files extracted from the data within the picture.

Using cat "filename" we can see the contents of each file. 

One of them contained the flag (1604355170.2064953-ed9fb0127e9fc478eb0558ea8cad306d)
